I.PI_caculation_from_input_bi
1.PI_caculation_from_input_bi_v1.pl
	1.read allele frequency table and generate Hash of Hash;
	2.get the minimal allele frequency of each locus,if allele of locus is not in the table, we use minimal allele frequency in the locus;
	3.get locus, child profile and father profile from input, get PI, and print it to STDOUT;
	4.important, it can't caculate mutation locus;

II.PI_Caculation_triplet_input.pl
	1. can't get minmal alllele frequency of each locus,if allele of locua is not in the table, get error
	2. can't caculate mutation locus

II.PI_Caculation_from_profile_bi
1.PI_Caculation_from_profile_bi_v1.pl		test ok
	1.read allele frequency table and generate HoH;
	2.get the minimal allele frequency of each locus, if allele of locus is not in the table, we use minimal allele frequency in that locus;
	3.get locus, C_profile and F_profile from profile file, get PI of each locus;
	4.get CPI;
	5.important:can't caculate mutation
	6.important:not rounded 4 float
2.PI_Caculation_from_profile_bi_v2.pl 
	1.each pi of locus is rounded with 4 digital float
3.PI_Caculation_from_profile_bi_v3.pl 
	1.can get mutation pi
	2.important:PI value is rounded and mutation PI is not rounded because is too small
4.PI_Caculation_from_profile_bi_v4.pl 
	1.get option without in order

III.PI_Caculation_from_profile_tri
1.PI_Caculation_from_profile_tri_v1.pl
	1. option is not need in order
	2. read frequency table and generate hash of hash
	3. get minal allele frequency of each locus
	4. in genotype input, the order is father mother and child
	5. get PI and rounded to 4 digit
	6. if exists mutation, the pi is 1
2.PI_Caculation_from_profile_tri_v2.pl
	1. new algorithm
	2. 6. if exists mutation, the pi is 1
3.PI_Caculation_from_profile_tri_v3.pl
	1. new algorithm
	2. can caculate PI, if exists mutation
	3. PI format is in scientific and round 4 digital
4.PI_Caculation_from_profile_tri_v4.pl
	4. output tri_PI and FC_PI and MC_PI	
5.PI_Caculation_from_profile_v5.pl
	1. can be used in tri and bi 
6.PI_Caculation_from_profile_v6.pl
	1.can set display format include -precision -float -scientific
